4. Write a program to calculate a bike’s average consumption from the given total distance (integer value) travelled (in km) and spent fuel (in litters, float number – 2 decimal points).
     Test Data (Input):
     Input total distance in km: 350
     Input total fuel spent in liters: 5
     Expected Output:
     Average consumption (km/ltr) 70.000
5. Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
     Test Data (Input):
     Input x1: 25
     Input y1: 15
     Input x2: 35
     Input y2: 10
     Expected Output:
     Distance between the said points: 11.1803
6. Write a program to read an amount (doubleeger value) and break the amount doubleo the smallest possible number of bank notes.
     Test Data (input):
     Input the amount: 375
     Expected Output:
     There are:
           3 Note(s) of 100.00
           1 Note(s) of 50.00
           1 Note(s) of 20.00
           0 Note(s) of 10.00
           1 Note(s) of 5.00
           0 Note(s) of 2.00
           0 Note(s) of 1.00
7. Write a program to convert a given integer (in seconds) to hours, minutes and seconds.
     Test Data (Input):
     Input seconds: 25300
     Expected Output:
     There are:
     H:M:S - 7:1:40
8. Write a program that accepts 4 integer p, q, r, s from the user where q, r and s are positive and p is even. If q is greater than r and s is greater than p and if the sum of r and s is greater than the sum of p and q print "Correct values", otherwise print "Wrong values".
     Test Data (Input):
     Input the first integer: 35
     Input the second integer: 35
     Input the third integer: 15
     Input the fourth integer: 46
     Expected Output:
     Wrong values
9. Write a program that reads 5 numbers and sums all odd values between them.
     Test Data (Input):
     Input the first number: 11
     Input the second number: 17
     Input the third number: 13
     Input the fourth number: 12
     Input the fifth number: 5
     Expected Output:
     Sum of all odd values: 46
10. Write a program that reads two integers and checks whether they are multiplied or not.
      Test Data (Input):
      Input the first number: 5
      Input the second number: 15
      Expected Output:
      Multiplied!
